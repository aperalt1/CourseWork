Sequential Search:
	Assume
	1. probability of a successful search is equal to p(0 <= p <= 1)
	2. probability of the first match occuring in the ith position is the same for every i

With a successful search, the probability of the first match occuring in the ith position is p/n  for every i (n is length of the array)
Number of comparisons made: i

With an unsuccessful search, the number of comparisons will be n, with the probabilty of such a search being 1 - p

Cavg(n) = [(1 * (p / n)) + (2 * (p / n)) + . . . + (i * (p / n)) + . . . (n * (p / n))] + n * (1 - p)
	= (p / n) * [1 + 2 + . . . + i + . . . + n] + n(1 - p)
	= (p(n + 1)/2) + n(1 - p)


S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + (n - 1) + n
  = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + . . . + 2 + 1
2S = n(n + 1)
S = n(n + 1) / 2

if p = 1 => search is successful, number of probes is (n + 1) / 2


Amortized Efficiency:
- Does not apply to a single run of the algorithm 
- Applies to a suequece of operations performed on the same data structure
- Discovered by Robert Tarjan

O(g(n)) = { f(n) where there exists positive constants c and n_0 such that ) <= f(n) <= c * g(n) for all n >= n_0

Omega(g(n)) = { f(n) where there exists positive constants c and n_0 such that 0 <= c * g(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n_0

Theta(g(n)) = { f(n) where there exists positive constants c1, c2, and n_0 such that 0 <= c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 g(n) for all n >= n_0


Selection Sort:
Always makes n(n-1) / 2 comparisons
Always makes at most n - 1 swaps

for(int i = 0; i < arr.len; i++)
	for(int j = i + 1; j < arr.len; j++)
		if(arr[i] < arr[j])
			swap(i,j);
			

function bubblesort(int[] list)
while n > 0
{
	newN  = 0
	for i : 1 to n-1 do
		if list[i-1] > list[i]
			swap(i-1,i)
			newN = 1
	n = newN

A set of points (finite or infinite) in the plane is called convex if for any two points p and q in the set, the entire line segment with endpoints p and q belongs to the set.
The convex hull of a set S is the smallest convex set containing S.

Topological Sort: 3	5	7	8	10	11	2	9

Nodes: 		2	3	4	5	7	8	9	10

indegree:	1	0	0	0	2	2	1	2           (Number of nodes feeding into them)

Start at indegree of 0, every time you use a node, decrease the indegree of the nodes that are being fed by that node
